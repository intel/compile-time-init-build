# *cib* - Compile-time Initialization and Build

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

 *cib* is a C++ header-only library for building embedded firmware with reusable
components. It implements the compile-time initialization and build pattern. 
Instead of initializing components and registering callbacks at runtime, this
process is executed at compile-time using constexpr or consteval functions.

Firmware using *cib* is implemented as a collection of **components**. Each 
component provides **services** and **features** to the build. Component
**features** extend and provide new functionality to **services**.

*cib* is currently in a prerelease state and its API is subject to change.

## Installing / Getting started

*cib* is released as a single header file as well as the zipped github repo. 
To get started quickly, download the cib.hpp header from the 
[release area](https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/releases):

```shell
wget https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/releases/download/v0.1.0/cib.hpp
```

Another option is to include cib as a 
[git submodule](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) 
in your repo and add the cib directory in your CMakeLists.txt file:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(lib/compile-time-init-build)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Cib)
```

With either of these methods, include the cib.hpp header in your code to use it.

### Hello, world!

Since *cib* is a library for efficiently building firmware through composition
a simple example takes a few more lines than a typical "Hello, world!"

#### core.hpp
The `core` component of this example **exports** the `say_message` **service**. Pay close
attention to the `#include` directives in each file.
```c++
#include <cib/cib.hpp>

struct say_message : public cib::callback_meta<>{};

struct core {
    constexpr static auto config =
        cib::config(cib::exports<say_message>);
};
```
#### hello_world.hpp
The `hello_world` component **extends** the `say_message` **service** with new
contained in a lambda.
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cib/cib.hpp>

struct hello_world {
    constexpr static auto config =
        cib::config(
            cib::extend<say_message>([](){
                std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
            })        
        );
};
```
#### lazy_dog.hpp
Another component, `lazy_dog` is also extending the `say_message` **service**.
This time it is using a function pointer instead of a lambda. The function 
definition of `talk_about_the_dog` could also be placed in a `lazy_dog.cpp` 
file if desired.
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cib/cib.hpp>

struct lazy_dog {
    static void talk_about_the_dog() {
        std::cout << "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." << std::endl;
    }
    
    constexpr static auto config =
        cib::config(
            cib::extend<say_message>(talk_about_the_dog)        
        );
};
```
#### my_project.hpp
All the components are brought together in the project configuration, `my_project`.
```c++
#include "core.hpp"
#include "hello_world.hpp"
#include "lazy_dog.hpp"

struct my_project {
    constexpr static auto config =
        cib::components<core, hello_world, lazy_dog>;
};
```
#### main.cpp
The `cib::nexus` brings all the **services** and **features** together. This is
where the compile-time initialization and build process actually occurs.
```c++
#include "my_project.hpp"

cib::nexus<my_project> nexus{};

int main() {
    // services can be accessed directly from the nexus...
    nexus.service<say_message>();
    
    // ...or they can be accessed anywhere through cib::service
    nexus.init();
    cib::service<say_message>();
}
```
#### Execution
All of the initialization and registration occurs at compile-time, but the
new functionality is still executed at run-time:
```
shell> ./my_project
Hello, world!
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Hello, world!
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```

### Building

*cib* is built with CMake. The single header is built with the 
`release_header` target:

```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -t release_header
ls build/include/cib/ | grep cib.hpp
```

This combines all the *cib* header files in the `include` tree by recursively
including the `#include` directives and ignoring all other macros.

Unit tests are registered with CTest:

```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -t tests
ctest
```

This will build and run all the unit tests with CMake and Catch2.
