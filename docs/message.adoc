== The `message` library

See code at
https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/tree/main/include/msg.
Everything in the msg library is in the `msg` namespace.

=== Fields

A `field` represents a value, specified in bits, inside a unit of addressable
storage. Currently in the _cib_ library, storage is assumed to be in units of
`std::uint32_t`. A field is a view type: it defines how to access storage, but
it is an empty type.

Two things specify a `field`:

- a `field_spec_t` which specifies the name, the type and the size (in bits) of
  the field
- one or more `field_locator_t`â€‹s which determine how to read and write the field from
  storage

A `field` has two important member functions:
[source,cpp]
----
// where T is the type of the field

[[nodiscard]] constexpr static auto extract(auto const &data) -> T;
[[nodiscard]] constexpr static auto insert(auto &data, T value) -> void;
----

A field may also specify a xref:match.adoc#_what_is_a_matcher[`matcher`]; this
can be used to verify that a particular storage area contains the field. By
default this is xref:match.adoc#_basic_matchers[`match::always`].

For example, a field type looks like this:
[source,cpp]
----
using namespace msg;
using my_field =
    field<"my field",               // name
          std::uint32_t>            // type
            ::located<at{0_dw,      // offset in storage (32-bit words)
                         31_msb,    // most significant bit
                         24_lsb}>;  // least significant bit
----

A field can specify multiple `at` arguments if it has several disjoint parts. In
that case, earlier `at` arguments specify more significant bits in the field,
with later `at` arguments being less significant. For example:
[source,cpp]
----
using namespace msg;
using my_field =
    field<"my field",               // name
          std::uint16_t>            // type
            ::located<at{0_dw, 31_msb, 24_lsb},  // high byte
                      at{0_dw,  7_msb,  0_lsb}>; // low byte
----

Fields also expose several matcher aliases which can typically be used to
specify field values for a given message type; an example of this follows
shortly. Further, fields expose aliases for expressing themselves as fields with
the given matchers.

Field matchers can be found in
https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/tree/main/include/msg/field_matchers.hpp.
The most commonly used field matchers are `equal_to_t` (for testing if a field
has a certain value) and `in_t` (for testing if a field value lies within a set).

=== Messages

A message is a named collection of field types. A message can be associated with
the storage that contains it in two ways: owning, i.e. containing an array, or
as a view, i.e. containing a span.

For example, a message type looks like this:
[source,cpp]
----
using my_message_defn = msg::message<
    "my_message",                      // name
    my_field::WithRequired<0x80>>;     // field(s)

using my_message = msg::owning<my_message_defn>;
----

Here the message has only one field. `WithRequired<0x80>` is an alias
specialization that expresses `my_field` with a matcher that is
`equal_to_t<0x80>`.

==== Field ordering

Fields are canonically ordered within a message definition by their least
significant bit, lowest to highest. Message definitions which differ only by
declaration order of fields are therefore the same type.

[source,cpp]
----
using field1 = field<"f1", std::uint32_t>::located<at{0_dw, 7_msb, 0_lsb}>;
using field2 = field<"f2", std::uint32_t>::located<at{0_dw, 15_msb, 8_lsb}>;

using message1_defn = message<"msg", field1, field2>;
using message2_defn = message<"msg", field2, field1>;
static_assert(std::same_as<message1_defn, message2_defn>);
----

==== Extending messages

It is sometimes useful to extend a message definition with more fields, to avoid
repetition. For example, with a partial message definition representing a
header:

[source,cpp]
----
using type_f = field<"type", std::uint32_t>::located<at{0_dw, 7_msb, 0_lsb}>;
using header_defn = message<"header", type_f>;
----

This definition can be extended with `extend`, giving a new name and some more fields:

[source,cpp]
----
using payload_f = field<"payload", std::uint32_t>::located<at{0_dw, 15_msb, 8_lsb}>;

// these two definitions are equivalent:
using msg_defn = extend<header_defn, "msg", payload_f>; // extend the header with a payload
using msg_alt_defn = message<"msg", type_f, payload_f>; // or define the entire message
----

Fields that exist in the base definition will be overridden by extension
fields with the same name. This also means that extending a message definition
in this way can add matchers to existing fields:

[source,cpp]
----
using msg1_defn = extend<header_defn, "msg", type_f::WithRequired<1>, payload_f>;
using msg2_defn = extend<header_defn, "msg", type_f::WithRequired<2>, payload_f>;
----

==== Owning vs view types

An owning message uses underlying storage: by default, this is a `std::array` of
`std::uint32_t` whose size is enough to hold all the fields in the message.
[source,cpp]
----
// by default, my_message will contain a std::array<std::uint32_t, 1>
using my_message = msg::owning<my_message_defn>;

// two corresponding default view types:

// holds a stdx::span<std::uint32_t, 1>
using mutable_view = msg::mutable_view<my_message_defn>;

// holds a stdx::span<std::uint32_t const, 1>
using const_view = msg::const_view<my_message_defn>;
----

The storage for a message can be customized with a tailored `std::array`:
[source,cpp]
----
// an owning message with the same fields and access, but different storage:
auto msg = my_message_defn::owner_t{std::array<std::uint8_t, 4>{}};

// another way to get the view types from that owning message
auto mut_view = msg.as_mutable_view();
auto const_view = msg.as_const_view();
----

View types are implicitly constructible from the corresponding owning types, or
from an appropriate `std::array` or `stdx::span`, where they are const. A
mutable view type must be constructed explicitly.

Owning types can also be constructed from views, arrays and spans - but always
explicitly: since they are owning, they always incur a copy.

Fields can be set and retrieved in a message, including on construction:
[source,cpp]
----
auto msg = my_message{"my_field"_field = 42};
auto f = my_message.get("my_field"_field);    // 42
my_message.set("my_field"_field = 17);
----

Fields can also be set and retrieved on mutable view type messages. For obvious
reasons, calling `set` on a const view type is a compile error. Likewise,
setting a field during construction of a const view type is not possible.

The raw data underlying a message can be obtained with a call to `data`:
[source,cpp]
----
auto data = msg.data();
----

This always returns a (const-observing) `stdx::span` over the underlying data.

=== Handling messages with callbacks

_cib_ contains an implementation of a basic message handler which can be used in
the obvious way: given some storage, the handler will run matchers from various
messages; when a matcher successfully matches, the callback(s) registered will be called.
[source,cpp]
----
// given the above field and message types, define a service
struct my_service : msg::service<my_message> {};

// define a callback with the matcher from the message definition
constexpr auto my_callback = msg::callback<"my_callback">(
    typename my_message_defn::matcher_t{},
    [](msg::const_view<my_message_defn>) { /* do something */ });

// define a project
struct my_project {
    constexpr static auto config = cib::config(
        cib::exports<my_service>,
        cib::extend<my_service>(my_callback));
};
----

In this case, the callback parameter is a `const_view` over the message
definition as explained above. Given these definitions, we can create a `nexus`
and ask the service to handle a message:

[source,cpp]
----
cib::nexus<my_project> my_nexus{};
my_nexus.init();

// handling this message calls my callback
using msg::operator""_field;
cib::service<my_service>->handle(my_message{"my field"_field = 0x80});
----

Notice in this case that our callback is defined with the `matcher_t` from the
message definition; that matcher is the conjunction of all the field matchers,
and the `my_field` matcher requires it to equal `0x80`. Therefore, handling
the following message will not call the callback:

[source,cpp]
----
// handling this message does not call my callback
// because my_message's field matcher does not match
cib::service<my_service>->handle(my_message{"my_field"_field = 0x81});
----

NOTE: Because message view types are implicitly constructible from an owning
message type _or_ from an appropriate `std::array`, it is possible to set up a
service and handler that works with "raw data" in the form of a `std::array`,
but whose callbacks and matchers take the appropriate message view types.

This machinery for handling messages with callbacks is fairly basic and can be
found in
https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/tree/main/include/msg/callback.hpp
and
https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/tree/main/include/msg/handler.hpp.

A more interesting (and better-performing) way to handle message dispatching is
with _indexed_ callbacks.

=== Indexed callbacks

The code for defining indexed callbacks and their handling is almost the same as
for the non-indexed case, with the addition that we need to say which fields to
build indices on:
[source,cpp]
----
// index on my_field
using my_indices = msg::index_spec<my_field>;

// the service is now an indexed_service
struct my_indexed_service : msg::indexed_service<my_indices, my_message> {};

// this time, the callback is an indexed_callback
constexpr auto my_callback = msg::indexed_callback<"my_indexed_callback">(
    typename my_message_defn::matcher_t{},
    [](msg::const_view<my_message_defn>) { /* do something */ });

// everything else is the same
----

=== How does indexing work?

NOTE: This section documents the details of indexed callbacks. It's not required
to understand this to _use_ indexed callbacks.

Indexing callbacks properly, interacting with arbitrary matchers, and calling
the appropriate callbacks on reception of a message involves several pieces that
work together. We leverage information known at compile time so as to expend
minimal effort at runtime.

==== Building the indices

For each field in the `msg::index_spec`, we build a map from field values to
bitsets, where the values in the bitsets represent callback indices.

NOTE: The bitsets may be run-length encoded by using the `rle_indexed_service`
inplace of the `indexed_service`. This may be useful if you have limited space
and/or a large set of possible callbacks.
See xref:implementation_details.adoc#run_length_encoded_message_indices[Run Length
Encoding Implementation Details]


Each `indexed_callback` has a matcher that may be an
xref:match.adoc#_boolean_algebra_with_matchers[arbitrary Boolean matcher
expression]. The `indexed_callback` construction process ensures that this
matcher is in xref:match.adoc#_disjunctive_normal_form[sum of products form].
The process of handling messages works by set intersection on the bitsets, so
each separate `or`â€‹ed term at the top level within each matcher (as well as each
matcher itself) must conceptually map to a separate callback.

The initialization process when `indexed_callback`â€‹s are added to the builder
takes care of this top-level concern, so that at build time, each callback
matcher is a suitable Boolean term (either a single term, a negation or a
conjunction, but not a disjunction).

The process of populating the field maps is then as follows:

- Walk the matcher expression, outputting all the positive (non-negated) terms.
  Each such term is a field matcher specifying a field and a value. Add an entry
  to the appropriate field map, where the key is the matched value and the
  current callback index is added into the bitset value.

- Any callback index not represented in the value bitsets of the map is collected
  into the default bitset. This is saying that if we don't have a key in the map
  for a given message field value, we'll call the callbacks that didn't specify
  that key.

- Walk the matcher expression again, this time outputting any negated terms. For
  each such term, add an entry in the map where the key is the field value and
  the value is the default bitset, excepting the current callback index. The
  current callback index is also added into all other values in the map.

- Take all the callback indices in the default bitset that were not used for
  negated terms, and propagate them to all the values in the map.

This process happens conceptually for each indexed field. Each such field then
has a map from field values to bitsets (representing indices of callbacks to call
when the field has that value), and a default bitset (indices of callbacks to
call when the field value was not found in the map).

That was perhaps hard to understand, so here are a couple of examples.

**Simple example**

Given two simple callback matchers:

  m[0] == my_field::equal_to_t<â€‹42>
  m[1] == my_field::equal_to_t<â€‹17>

First we walk the matcher expressions outputting the non-negated values. After
this stage, the data for `my_field` is:

  default_value = {}
  map = {
    17 -> {1},
    42 -> {0}
  }

i.e. each expected value is a key in the map, and the corresponding value in the
map is a bitset of the callbacks to be called when that value is seen.

Next we check the map for any unrepresented callbacks. In this case every
callback (0 and 1) is represented in the map, so the default value is unchanged.

Next we walk the matcher expressions again, outputting negated values. In this
case there are none, so nothing happens.

Finally we propagate the "positive" value from the default value. Again in this
case it's empty, so no change. The final data for `my_field` is:

  default_value = {}
  map = {
    17 -> {1},
    42 -> {0}
  }

  // recall:
  m[0] == my_field::equal_to_t<â€‹42>
  m[1] == my_field::equal_to_t<â€‹17>

Now consider this in action.

- If we get a message where `my_field` is 42, callback 0 will be eligible.
- If we get a message where `my_field` is 17, callback 1 will be eligible.
- If we get a message where `my_field` is another value, no callback will be eligible.

All correct.

**Slightly more complex example**

Given three callback matchers:

  m[0] == my_field::equal_to_t<â€‹42>
  m[1] == not my_field::equal_to_t<â€‹17>
  m[2] == another_field::equal_to_t<â€‹3>

First we walk the matcher expressions outputting the non-negated values. After
this stage, the data for `my_field` is:

  default_value = {}
  map = {
    42 -> {0}
  }

(`m[1]` is a negated value, so it is not yet considered, and `m[2]` contained no
data for `my_field`.)

Next we check the map for any unrepresented callbacks. In this case callbacks 1
and 2 do not occur, so they are added to the defaults. The current data for
`my_field` is:

  default_value = {1,2}
  map = {
    42 -> {0}
  }

Next we walk the matcher expressions again, outputting negated values (`m[1]`).
Now the `my_field` data becomes:

  default_value = {1,2}
  map = {
    17 -> {2}
    42 -> {0,1}
  }

i.e. the entry with value 17 was populated with the defaults, minus its own
index (1), and its own index (1) was entered into all the other mapped values.

Finally we propagate the "positive" defaults, i.e. `{2}` (because index 1 was
associated with a negative term). The final data for `my_field`:

  default_value = {1,2}
  map = {
    17 -> {2}
    42 -> {0,1,2}
  }

  // recall:
  m[0] == my_field::equal_to_t<â€‹42>
  m[1] == not my_field::equal_to_t<â€‹17>
  m[2] == another_field::equal_to_t<â€‹3>

Now consider this in action.

- If we get a message where `my_field` is 42, callbacks  0, 1 and 2 will be eligible.
- If we get a message where `my_field` is 17, callback 2 will be eligible.
- If we get a message where `my_field` is another value, callbacks 1 and 2 will be eligible.

Again, all correct.

Remember that this is only considering the indexing on `my_field` to assess
eligibility: those bitsets would then be intersected with bitsets obtained by a
similar process on `another_field`.

Working through more complex examples is left as an exercise to the reader.

==== Lookup strategies

Given an index map on a field, at compile time we can decide which runtime
lookup strategy to use. All the code for this is found in
https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/tree/main/include/lookup.

There are three main lookup strategies:

- linear search - this is suitable for a small number of possible field values.
- direct array indexing - this is suitable when the min and max values are not
  too far apart, and the data is populated not too sparsely (a hash map is
  likely sparse, so this could be thought of as a very fast hash map that uses
  the identity function).
- hash lookup - using a "bad" hash function.

For any given data, the lookup strategy is selected at compile time from a long
list of potential strategies ordered by speed and found in
https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/tree/main/include/lookup/strategy/arc_cpu.hpp.

With compile-time selection, hash functions don't need to be judged according to
the usual criteria! We know the data; we just need something that is fast to
compute and collision-free. So it is fairly easy to generate "bad" hash
functions that are fast, and pick the first one that works according to the data
we have.

==== Handling messages

Having selected the indexing strategy, when a message arrives, we can handle it
as follows:

- for each indexed field, extract the field from the message and lookup (using
  an appropriate selected strategy) the bitset of callbacks.
- `and` together all the resulting bitsets (i.e. perform their set intersection).

This gives us the callbacks to be called. Each callback still has an associated
matcher that may include field constraints that were already handled by the
indexing, but may also include constraints on fields that were not indexed. With
a little xref:match.adoc#_boolean_algebra_with_matchers[Boolean matcher
manipulation], we can remove the fields that were indexed by setting them to
`match::always` and simplifying the resulting expression. This is decidable at
compile time.

For each callback, we now run the remaining matcher expression to deal with any
unindexed but constrained fields, and call the callback if it passes. Bob's your
uncle.
